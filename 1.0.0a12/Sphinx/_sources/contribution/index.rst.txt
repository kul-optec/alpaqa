How to contribute
=================

``alpaqa`` is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community. 
Whenever you have implemented a new feature, bugfix or any other contribution that could be of value in the main library and you would like to make a pull request, please consider the following. 

* Make sure that the code compiles without warnings.
* Use ``clang-format`` to format your changes (before committing).
* Add (unit) tests and documentation for your changes.

If you intend to open a pull request for a large feature, it might be worth
opening a discussion first.
